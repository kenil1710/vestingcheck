/**
 * Shared helpers for the VestingCheck integration scripts (Studio Dev).
 *
 * Two of these exist because a GenLayer network does not report success in one
 * place, and reading the wrong place turns every failure into a silent pass.
 *
 *   `outcomeOf`  — a revert is recorded in THREE different spellings:
 *       tx.txExecutionResultName === "FINISHED_WITH_ERROR",
 *       tx.consensus_data.leader_receipt[0].execution_result === "ERROR",
 *       tx.consensus_data.leader_receipt[0].result.status === "rollback".
 *     Studio Dev leaves `txExecutionResultName` UNDEFINED and uses the second
 *     and third. A check written against the first alone reads
 *     `undefined !== "FINISHED_WITH_ERROR"` and reports success for a
 *     transaction that reverted and rolled back.
 *
 *   `contractAddressOf` — the created address lives under `tx.data.contract_address`
 *     on Studio and `tx.txDataDecoded.contractAddress` elsewhere. Reading only
 *     one spelling yields `undefined` for a deploy that fully succeeded, and an
 *     undefined address fed into the next constructor becomes `Address("None")`
 *     there — a second deploy that reverts pointing at the wrong contract.
